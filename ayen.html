							<p>Ayen Ayuen is a 21-year-old, who currently lives in Melbourne, with her mum and dad and eight brothers and sisters. Ayen is originally from South Sudan. Her family migrated to Australia 12 years ago. The reason for moving to a place like Australia was to ensure that she and her varied amount of siblings could possibly pursue their best lives. Ayen has made the best of her opportunities and the freedom that Australia has given to her and her family. She currently has two part-time jobs. She supervises at Woolworths during the week and works as a personal carer at an aged care facility called Benfield at Philip Island on weekends. Ayen is also a second year Bachelor of Nursing student at Victoria University. Her life is quite hectic but she manages to make it work. She is a very passionate being and wishes to accomplish a lot in life. Her biggest goal is to give back and serve others as much as she can. This goal is her underlining reason as to why she wishes to pursue an IT degree. Technology to her is more than just games and selfie enhancement applications. She believes technology can be used to transform lives, whether if itâ€™s through simple applications and or life-changing medical adjustments like hearing aids for example. Ayen has a plan and understands partly what she needs to make these goals and plans happen, what she lacks is the knowledge and understanding of how IT processes work and or how a simple code can be manipulated into something useful. Through this Degree she wishes to hopefully gain the skills and knowledge that she can then use to make a difference in the world and or for the lives of those around her.</p>
