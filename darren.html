							<p>My name is Darren Borkett and I am Australian who has lived on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland for most of my adult life and I grew up in Vietnam prior to that. At present, I am employed as a cleaner which I have been doing for about four years. I also have a passion for music and play a few musical instruments, mainly piano, violin and guitar in a range of musical styles. I also like to learn new things and completed a Bachelor of Accounting in 2011.  Currently, I am working towards graded exams in both piano and violin. I first became interested in the field of Information Technology when I experimented with different programming languages, such as Visual Basic and Python, but just never committed to fully studying them. I grew up using computers like most of my generation and so am confident with navigating Windows. I am new to IT and have no experience in the industry but am keen to learn through the university degree online that I am currently doing.  I am especially programming, app development and diagnosing computer problems.  </p>
