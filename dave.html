							<p>Hi! My name's Dave. I live on the Central Coast of NSW and am of English background. I have a Certifcate 3 in Audio Engineering however this is my first time at university. I currently work in the Audio Visual/ Home Automation industry in which I have been working in for about 15 years. I am interested in changing vocation and hope to get a job in the IT industry. My hobbies include playing guitar and cooking, however, I don’t get too much time for guitar anymore as much of my time is spent looking after my 1 year old son.
I am looking forward to learning about the vast aspects of information technology and am interested in developing skills that I normally wouldn't have tried to learn off my own accord through this degree (for example building web pages). As I work part time currently and look after my son I have limited time during the day, this led me to online study through Open Univeristies and RMIT due to the fact that I can do the work during the time I have available.
I hope you enjoy the site! </p>
