							<p>Welcome, my name is Jonathan, I'm currently 36 years old and live in Hobart, Tasmania. I've worked in Disability Support for the past 10 years. I have a Sausage dog named Frank who is almost 4 years old. Most days we go out walking and visiting the local dog parks, I also enjoy Martial Arts and console gaming usually on PlayStation 4. I have always been interested in how IT works from a younger age but for the most part just as consumer enjoying the wonderful advancements we see to our mobile phone, pcs and gaming machines.</p>
							<p>I think the desire to expand my knowledge lead me to RMIT via OUA which allows me to study part-time online study which is helpful to me as i work full-time and with only having a very basic knowledge of IT. Through RMIT i would like to gain the skills to change my career into something more enjoyable in the IT area whilst working towards a Bachelors in IT.</p>
