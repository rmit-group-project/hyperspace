							<p>Overview

An affordable home automation system that is capable of controlling electronics such as lights, air conditioning, blinds, audio visual equipment, security systems and irrigation systems specifically but not exclusively for people with disabilities. The system can be controlled via eye motion, gestures, and voice as well as conventional methods such as a tactile remote and phone or tablet to cater for many forms of impairment or abilities. Today, systems such as this are available but can be very expensive and require an enormous amount of work from specialist trades therefore are unattainable for many people in the community. Our project will be a cloud-based software as a service solution alongside a priority networked processor with inputs and outputs such as infrared, RS232 and dry contact relays and physical remote.<br>
Jonathan (one of the team members) has worked with people who have disabilities for over a decade now and has found there is a long way to go in bringing home automation to people with a disability in an inexpensive and easy to operate way. He has seen the difficulties caused by this to people with disabilities and their families who cannot afford expensive home automation systems or don't have the technical knowledge to operate and add devices and functions to current less expensive units. This gave the motivation to the team to improve the quality of life and bring more independence to those with a disability and their families by creating a simplified way for people to operate their own electronic devices. .<br>
Almost everybody would know of somebody whether it be a family member, friend or colleague who at some point has had problems that result in loss of mobility and being restricted to very limited physical abilities where the simplest of life's pleasure that we often take for granted are no longer a simple exercise such as turning lights on/off, adjusting the temperature in your room or using a smart tv to stream a movie. Currently some of these things can be done with relative ease to some people and not others, a person with the inability to speak cannot use a voice control system but could possibly use an IOS/android device or motion tracking camera to track arm or eye motion. 
The product we are proposing is a cloud-based software service combined with a relatively basic hardware component which will perform the task of providing physical connectivity to subsystems within the home as well as an interface for the end user. The cloud-based functionality enables us to have the large amount of processing power required by voice and gesture control as well as the control capabilities needed for automation away from an expensive unit in the home. The cloud service will consist of a database of software drivers that are pre written for sub systems in the home such as lighting, audio visual equipment and air conditioning systems which can be chosen depending on what is needing to be controlled. The hardware component then can be an interface to these products through control mediums such as infrared, RS232 or ethernet protocol which will connect to the customers home router and can access the internet from here. As this is a cloud based service the customer will also be provided with remote access of the system enabling them to control their home from anywhere in the world. .<br>

To install the system the customer sets up an online account and from there a piece of software called a wizard helps them choose several drivers based on the products they have in their home and what they would like to control. After choosing the drivers the wizard then helps make the physical connections between the controller and their products and tracks this making the software bindings to be able to control products correctly. This process should empower the customers to be able to set up the system without the need of costly specialist technicians.
The potential of what could be added to the list of possible uses for a device are endless and as a cloud-based service this allows us to perform updates and release new functionality without the customer having to re purchase hardware or software.
